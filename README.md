This code sets up a Node.js server using Express framework to handle HTTP requests. It integrates MongoDB with Mongoose for database operations. CORS middleware is employed for cross-origin resource sharing. The server listens on port 5000 and connects to a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. It utilizes a separate route handler for managing book-related API endpoints. The code establishes a connection to the database upon server initialization and logs a message upon successful connection. Overall, it creates a RESTful API for book management with robust error handling and middleware integration.
